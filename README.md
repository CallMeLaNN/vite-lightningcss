# UnoCSS + LightningCSS

Extracted from [UnoCSS example](https://github.com/unocss/unocss/blob/main/examples/vite-lightningcss) for trying it myself. I don't know where is the Stackblitz example.

Result for production build for my own reference:

- TailwindCSS: 14.9 kB - is a fixed css file with all the css classes (not doing PurgeCSS)
- UnoCSS: 2.1 kB - based on this small sample

Not a fair comparison and not to compare actually but I wanted to try my own on how fast it can compile together with LightningCSS.

BTW, since on-demand css compilation exist, why bother having big then purge it?
